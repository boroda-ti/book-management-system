# Book Management API

#### A RESTful API built with FastAPI for managing users, authors, books and genres

## Features
- User registration and authentication with JWT
- Role-based permissions (user, admin)
- Filtering, Pagination and Sorting for retrieve books endpoint
- Import and Export books in JSON and CSV formats
- Unit and Integration tests with database for testing
- Custom Validation and Error Handling
- Rate-limiter for only 5 requests per 1 minute for each endpoint
- Deployed on AWS Lambda and RDS

## Next steps
1. Personalized Book Recommendation System

    To implement this system we need to provide some changes:
    - Create a table like `user_activity(book_id, user_id, action, timestamp)`
    - Log actions such as: viewed, opened details, favorited, exported
    - Prepare recommendation data
        - For collaborative filtering
            - Use `user_id` and `book_id` interactions
        - For content-based filtering
            - Use book `genre`, `author_ids`, `published_year`, etc.
    - Build a simple ML model
        - Use libraries
            - `Surprise` - for collaborative filtering
            - `LightFM` â€“ hybrid (collaborative + content-based)
    - Add `/recommendations/` route

2. Testing

    To make sure API works correctly without making manual testing we need to provide Integration and Unit tests.
    | Module | Unit tests | Integration tests |
    | ------ | ---------- | ----------------- |
    | Auth | + | + |
    | Author | - | - |
    | Books | - | - |
    | Genre | - | - |
    | Admin | - | - |

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.12
- FastAPI
- PostgreSQL
- `uv` package manager (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`)

## Deploy
This API is deployed on AWS Lambda with FastAPI + Mangum, connected to a PostgreSQL instance on AWS RDS.
- Public endpoint: [url](https://y5h7vnrm7elq6fw2skg3eic7fm0rtfva.lambda-url.eu-north-1.on.aws/)

>**Note:** Currently some endpoints do not work, i had no experience with Lambda so i do not know why, trying to fix

## Build & Run Locally
1. Setup .env file (in general directory ./.env)
    - TESTING=0
    - DB_USER
    - DB_PASSWORD
    - DB_HOST
    - DB_PORT
    - DB_NAME
    - DB_USER_TEST
    - DB_PASSWORD_TEST
    - DB_HOST_TEST
    - DB_PORT_TEST
    - DB_NAME_TEST
    - JWT_SECRET_KEY
    - JWT_ALGORITHM
    - JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES

2. Setup `uv`
    - Install it to global python interpreter ([docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/))
    - `uv pip install -r pyproject.toml`

3. Make a migrations
    - `psql -h <host> -U <user> -d <dbname> -f app\models\schema.sql`

4. Run FastAPI
    - `uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload`

5. Add admin user (optional)
    - Create user follow the endpoints
    - `psql -h <host> -U <user> -d <dbname>`
    - `UPDATE users SET is_admin = TRUE WHERE id = <created_user_id>;`

6. Run tests (optional)
    - `uv run pytest -v`
